Let's see what my picks say about me, shall we? Going clockwise from the bottom, we have...

## Animal Crossing: Wild World (Nintendo DS, 2005)

Something about this game really hits. The DS was positioned at a perfect time where it could render 3D, but with only [4 of god's own megabytes of RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Technical_specifications), the fidelity was limited. As a result, we get this perfect blend of 2D and 3D elements, that I feel like is at its most noticable in "*Wild World*". In fact, the entire top screen of this game was purely 2D, but it still felt organic and seamless with the 3D world below. 

The flowers and items were [all spritework](https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/animalxingwildworld/), and the character textures were suitably low-resolution. Buildings and furniture made [liberal use of stencil cutouts](https://textures.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/animalxingwildworld/asset/375463/) to convey details, rather than complex meshes. The game also famously allowed you to design your town's flag and tailor your own clothes by drawing on a 32x32 pixel canvas. Because everything else in the game was similarly low-res, this made it easier for your own designs to fit right in, even if you were a complete artistic novice.

I'm very fond of the way this game looks, but visuals aside, there's a lot of charm in the actual gameplay, too. Most notably, the villagers felt alive, and like they had actual agency. They could invite themselves over. They could need cheering up. They could get mad at you and say *mean* things. The villagers, to me, were the heart and soul of these games. But, given that these aspects of villager personality were all sanded off in "*New Horizons*", Nintendo clearly felt otherwise. Oh well.

## Zoo Tycoon (PC, 2001)

## Sly 2: Band of Thieves (PS2, 2004)

While the original "*Sly Cooper*" was a relatively standard early-2000s mascot-platformer fare, "*Sly 2*" elevated the franchise into a family-friendly crime drama. This game is, in all likelihood, responsible for my keen interest in "*Lupin the 3rd*" later in life.

This game has exceptionally strong voice acting and writing for what it was, and I firmly believe that

## Dark Cloud (PS2, 2001)

---

## Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (PS2, 2004)

It's Metal Gear Solid 3. Need I say more? I think this one's on everyone's list. I think I can quote the entire script by memory. "*After the end of World War 2... the world was split into two...*"

## Katamari Damacy (PS2, 2004)

My general opinion of this game can best be summarized by this viral post, from February 2023:

[![Katamari Damacy is the game ever .you select a level and your giant father calls you a shithead to your face and then places you on earth and tells you to go roll up some fish for 10 minutes and then the  best song you've ever heard starts playing](/img/blogs/ten-games-2025/katamari-tumblr.png)](https://www.tumblr.com/footlongdingledong/709992850432098304/katamari-damacy-is-the-game-ever-your-giant-father)

It's all true. This game taught me that games can truly be anything. Narrow cultural perceptions of "*conflict*" and "*objective*" are blinders that stifle creative vision. *This* is what it's all about.

My favorite song from the franchise is "[*Cherry Blosson Color Season*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGJr8VuYPtc)".

## EverBlue 2 (PS2, 2002)

## Grim Fandango (PC, 1998)

Probably the least surprising entry on this entire list for a guy like me. This game upended my whole situation and dramatically altered the course of my afterlife. Manny Calavera is one of the all-time greats among skeletonkind, and inspired me to be as much like him as I could.

This game gets a somewhat-deserved rap for having particularly unintuitive puzzles. I think this 

As a fun piece of trivia, the [same fellow](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566308/) composed the soundtrack for this game and the aformentioned "*Sly 2*".

## WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne (PC, 2003)

WarCraft 3's "*World Editor*" is where I learned how to program. Using a language called [JASS (Just Another Scripting Syntax)](https://jass.sourceforge.net/doc/), you could go beyond the confines of the drag-and-drop event editor and produce some truly impressive things. I've seen nearly every genre of game recreated in WarCraft 3, including [arena shooters](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/tcx-1-03b.80762/).

Unfortunately, in 2020, Blizzard decided to fully lobotomize themselves by releasing "*WarCraft 3: Reforged*", and in the same swift motion, permanently decomissioned the original WarCraft 3. I'm unclear on if the old custom maps still work, but I have to imagine that some percentage of them became lost or broken in the migration. 

My favorite of these custom maps was "*Island Troll Tribes*", but...

### DOTA 2 (PC, 2011)

By extension, this led directly in to me playing DOTA 2 when it rolled out as a private beta back in 2011. I have a fun relationship with the MOBA genre. I call them "*DOTAlikes*", because I think "[*Multiplayer Online Battle Arena*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)" is vague enough to describe basically every PvP game in existence, when in reality the term is typcially meant to convey the specificity of lane-pushers. 

Anyway, a lot of people cite these types of games as being rage-enducing exercises in self-loathing. This is probably true, to a point. But in my case, DOTA taught me a valuable lesson in anger management: it bombards you with so many small grievances, that you swiftly learn that you simply cannot afford to mad at every little thing, or it really will burn you out completely. I think a lot of players fail to reach this epiphany and live in a hell of their own making. But I have achieved enlightenment and find DOTA to be a chill adventure. At the time of this writing, I'm a [pretty good Warlock player](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/45996281/matches?hero=warlock).

It likely also helps that I've been playing consistently with the same friend since 2011. Some people go hang out at bars, we hang out in the offlane.
