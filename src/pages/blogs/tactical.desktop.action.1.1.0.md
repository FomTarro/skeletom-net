Happy birthday, Mint! This was a fun one to put together, with some features that I feel deliver real value.

### Additions:

- <span class="highlight">YouTube Go-Live Alerts</span>! Mint will CALL you on the Codec when she goes live. Never miss a stream again! There’s no excuse.
- <span class="highlight">Calendar</span> and <span class="highlight">Event Alerts</span>! Manage your calendar and get a CALL from Mint to remind you of your tasks for the day. You can even import and export <span class="highlight">.ICS files</span>, offering full compatibility with most major calendar apps, such as Google Calendar!


### Updates:

- The <span class="highlight">Clock</span> can now select <span class="highlight">any time zone</span> in the world. Yes, you can finally find out what time it is in the Fox Archipelago.
- The <span class="highlight">Music Player</span> now supports lossless <span class="highlight">.FLAC files</span>. Go wild, audio freaks.


### Quality-of-(After)Life Fixes and Improvements:

- You can now opt to <span class="highlight">skip the intro/exit cutscenes</span> on subsequent launches from the Settings menu.
- You can opt in and out of the YouTube and Calendar Alerts from the Settings menu as well.
- The application <span class="highlight">no longer suppresses OS notifications</span> as though it were a normal full-screen window.
- The application now <span class="highlight">properly handles launching on secondary monitors</span> (previously failed to calculate window borders).

## Behind The Scenes

Now for the part of the blog post where I go in to excruciating detail about the work that went in to getting this update out the door. The new features might look rather mundane, but there was a lot of learning involved.
