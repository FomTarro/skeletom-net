## Background

This app was commissioned by [KKCYBER](https://kkcyber.neocities.org/) at around the time the Japanese app "[Desktop Mate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301060/Desktop_Mate/)" was going viral on social media. While that app allowed users to import any old VRM model skeleton and have it do some generic animations on their desktop, KK wanted something with, in her own words, "more soul". 


Thus, she reached out to me as I have a [proven track record for this kind of thing](/projects?tags=desktop%20toy), and 2 months later this application came to be, in honor of her 4th streaming anniversary on 4/04. Thank you for the opportunity, KK!
