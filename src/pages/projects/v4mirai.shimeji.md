## Background

Hand illustrated and animated by Lunalia themselves, the Lunalia Shimeji collections puts these beloved VTubers right on your desktop!

For those not in the know, "Shimeji" is a framework for making little characters that run around your desktop. You can pick them up and fling them around. My earlier project, [AmiyAmiga](/projects/amiyamiga) is similar in concept (though AmiyAmiga is 100% engineered by me, not using an existing framework).

My contributiona to this project were twofold:
1. Figuring out how to get the [decade-old Shimeji codebase](https://github.com/TigerHix/shimeji-ee) to compile with modern tools.
2. Updating said codebase with new features, such as allowing the characters to have special actions at different times of day and allowing them to open and move image files from a bundled folder.

It was an honor and joy to work with the talents before their debut getting this ready!
