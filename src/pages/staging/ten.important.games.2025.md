Let's see what my picks say about me, shall we? Going clockwise from the bottom:

---

## Animal Crossing: Wild World (Nintendo DS, 2005)

---

## Zoo Tycoon (PC, 2001)

---

## Sly 2: Band of Thieves (PS2, 2004)

While the original "*Sly Cooper*" was a relatively standard early-2000s mascot-platformer fare, "*Sly 2*" elevated

---

## Dark Cloud (PS2, 2001)

---

## Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (PS2, 2004)

---

## Katamari Damacy (PS2, 2004)

---

## EverBlue 2 (PS2, 2002)

---

## Grim Fandango (PC, 1998)

Probably the least surprising entry on this entire list. This game upended my whole situation and dramatically altered the course of my afterlife. Manny Calavera is one of the all-time greats among skeletonkind.

As a fun piece of trivia, the [same fellow](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566308/) composed the soundtrack for this game and the aformentioned "*Sly 2*".

## WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne (PC, 2003)

WarCraft 3's "*World Editor*" is where I learned how to program. Using a language called [JASS (Just Another Scripting Syntax)](https://jass.sourceforge.net/doc/), you could go beyond the confines of the drag-and-drop event editor and produce some truly impressive things.

Unfortunately, in 2020, Blizzard decided to fully lobotomize themselves by releasing "*WarCraft 3: Reforged*", and in the same swift motion, permanently decomissioned the original WarCraft 3. In doing this, they functionally burned (or attempted to burn) their own Library of Alexandria's worth of custom maps and user-made tooling for no discernable reason. Godlike business acumen, those guys have.

### DOTA 2 (PC, 2011)

By extension, this led directly in to me playing DOTA 2 when it rolled out as a private beta back in 2011. I have a fun relationship with the MOBA genre. I call them "*DOTAlikes*", because I think "[*Multiplayer Online Battle Arena*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)" is vague enough to describe basically every PvP game in existence, when in reality the term is typcially meant to convey the specificity of lane-pushers. 

Anyway, a lot of people cite these types of games as being rage-enducing exercises in self-loathing. This is probably true, to a point. But in my case, DOTA taught me a valuable lesson in anger management: you simply cannot afford to mad at every little thing, or it really will burn you out completely. I think a lot of players fail to reach this epiphany and live in a hell of their own making. But I have achieved enlightenment and find DOTA to be a chill adventure. At the time of this writing, I'm a [pretty good Warlock player](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/45996281/matches?hero=warlock).

It likely also helps that I've been playing consistently with the same friend since 2011. Some people go hang out at bars, we hang out in the offlane.
