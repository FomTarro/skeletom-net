## Background

The OshiLive Autographer is a browser-based JavaScript canvas that transmits brush-strokes securely across network to a remote CNC machine. It used at the [OffKai 2024 VTuber Convention](https://www.offkaiexpo.com/) to allow call-in celebrity guests (VTubers) to sign personalized autographs for attendees at the convention from across the world.

The tool was designed, built and delivered to client ([OshiLive](https://www.oshilive.com/)) in under 30 days using an Agile development cycle.

## Media

Here's a video of the tool working. In practice, the drawing pad and the CNC machine were separated by hundreds, if not thousands of miles.

The tool was able to produce signatures that look effectively hand-written, because they basically are! Here's an example.
