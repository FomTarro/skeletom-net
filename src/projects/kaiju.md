## Background

Made in a weekend for the [2nd VTuber Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/2nd-vtuber-game-jam), KAIJU is an homage to the [Game & Watch LCD games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch), as well as retired VTuber Furuya Mari.

The game only requires two buttons, and is playable in-browser! Even on mobile phones, too!
