Also, this post serves the secondary purpose of being a demonstration of the handy "Related Projects" tab on this page, which offers you direct access to [learn more about TourKoal](/projects/tourkoal) with just one click. Magical.

## Usage Statistics

The first major feature that I'm aiming to add is a set of Usage Statistic graphics. Well, calling them "graphics" may be slightly misleading; like the Pokemon Icons, these would be OBS Browser Sources, constructed entirely out of HTML.

I've been hesitant to add such a complex element, because while Pokemon Icons look fine with a transparent background and no additional styling, a Usage graphic would require a fair bit of work from the end-user before it looks presentable. I'm not sure how willing your average Tournament Organizer would be to willing to learn or write their own CSS

## Teamsheet Scanning

As always, thank you for your continued interest in the tool! I am continually delighted to see new events of all sizes finding value in my work.
