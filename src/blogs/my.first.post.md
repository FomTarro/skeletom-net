Hey! Welcome to my brand new homepage! 

<!--more-->

Having a totally hand-made homepage is something I've wanted for a while. What you see before you was all lovingly assembled in vanilla HTML and CSS, with no frameworks to speak of! A rarity in the modern age, to be sure.

The basic plan here to to provide a central place for catalogging all of my [projects](/projects), as well as to give myself a place to write some longform [blog posts](/blogs) about them. In practice, you can probably expect to find patch notes and release information interspersed between my thoughts about the latest competitive Pok√©mon trends.


Thanks for stopping by! I hope to contine to polish and expand this place as time goes on!

Oh, and before you go: don't forget to check out the fine assortment of 88x31 badges at the bottom of the page! That collection will only continue to grow.
