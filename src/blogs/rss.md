If you've ever wanted to keep tabs on when I post new project updates, or just have something pithy to say, BUT you're also living in the year 2005 and Twitter hasn't been invented yet, you can now subscribe to my shiny new [RSS Feed](/rss/rss.xml)!

## What is RSS?

RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication" and is a [standard protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) for aggregating news articles from disparate websites. It was hugely useful from the era before the entire internet was centralized around single sites like Twitter or Facebook.


You can take the URL [`https://www.skeletom.net/rss/rss.xml`](/rss/rss.xml) and plug it in to your favorite RSS Feed Reader and get notified when I publish new work! Technology is amazing.
