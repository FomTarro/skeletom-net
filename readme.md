### **July 17th, 2021**
* Ran `npm init` to make a brand new `package.json` file.
* Ran `npm install express` to download the `express` server library.
* Filled out `index.js` with very basic web server setup.
* Informed the server  where to serve static files (html, images, etc) from.
* Added an example redirect endpoint to the server.

#### **End Result**
An unstyled home page that include static text and a static image, being served out of the `public/` file directory by express.
